# diploid-breseq

This version of _breseq_ has extra capability to predict SNPs and small indels in multiploid genomes installs `diplod-breseq` and `diploid-gdtools` so that it will not conflict with a normal _breseq_ installation.

Please see the documentation file `diploid.html` of the documentation usage instructions.
